# Client (Vite + React)

This project uses Vite and React (JavaScript). It mounts the existing `App.jsx` as the root component.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server (runs on port 3000):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- The dev server port is configured in `vite.config.js` as `3000`.
- If you prefer `yarn`: `yarn` then `yarn dev`.
